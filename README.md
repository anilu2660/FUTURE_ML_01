ðŸ§  AI-Powered Sales Forecasting Dashboard

This project builds an AI-powered dashboard for predicting and visualizing sales using Machine Learning (XGBoost). The model learns patterns from historical sales data, applies feature engineering (lags, rolling averages, date-based features), and generates forecasts to help businesses make data-driven decisions.

ðŸš€ Features

Loads and processes sales data from CSV (dataset.csv)

Aggregates daily sales and engineers predictive features

Trains an XGBoost regression model for sales forecasting

Generates multiple visualizations:

Actual vs. Predicted Sales (line chart)

Scatter plot (Actual vs. Predicted)

Residual plot

Feature importance ranking

Saves predictions to sales_forecast_predictions.csv

Calculates evaluation metrics:

Mean Squared Error (MSE)

Mean Absolute Error (MAE)

RÂ² Score

Accuracy within 10% tolerance

ðŸ“Š Example Outputs

Actual vs. Predicted Sales

Scatter Plot: Actual vs. Predicted

Residual Plot

Feature Importances (XGBoost)

ðŸ“ˆ Model Performance

The model evaluates accuracy using multiple metrics:

MSE â€“ Mean Squared Error

MAE â€“ Mean Absolute Error

RÂ² Score â€“ Goodness of fit

Accuracy within 10% tolerance

ðŸ”® Future Improvements

Add support for seasonal decomposition (SARIMA/Prophet)

Deploy as a web dashboard (e.g., Flask/Streamlit)

Automate data pipeline for live sales updates

Enhance visualization with interactive charts
